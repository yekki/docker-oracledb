## Run
Create and run a container named orcl:
```
$ docker run --privileged -dP --name orcl yekki/odb12c

989f1b41b1f00c53576ab85e773b60f2458a75c108c12d4ac3d70be4e801b563
```
Yes, alas, this has to run `privileged` in order to gain permission for the `mount` statement in `/tmp/start` that ups the amount of shared memory, which has a hard value of 64M in Docker; see this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/4981)

## Connect
The default password for the `sys` user is `change_on_install`, and for `system` it's `manager`
The `ORCL` database port `1521` is bound to the Docker host through `run -P`. To find the host's port:
```
$ docker port orcl 1521
0.0.0.0:49189
```
So from the host, you can connect with `system/manager@localhost:49189/orcl`
Though if using [Boot2Docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker), you need the actual ip address instead of `localhost`:
```
$ boot2docker ip

The VM's Host only interface IP address is: 192.168.59.103

```
If you're looking for a databse client, consider [sqlplus](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-100365.html)
```
$ sqlplus system/manager@192.168.59.103:49189/orcl

## Monitor
The container runs a process that starts up the database, and then continues to check each minute if the database is still running, and start it if it's not. To see the output of that process:
```
$ docker logs orcl

## Build
Should you want to modify & build your own image:

#### Step 1
1) Download `linuxamd64_12102_database_1of2.zip` & `linuxamd64_12102_database_2of2.zip` from [Oracle Tech Net](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/database12c-linux-download-2240591.html)

2) Put the 2 zip files in the `step1` directory

3) `cd` to the `oracle-12c` repo directory

4) `$ docker build -t oracle-12c:step1 step1`

5) `$ docker run --privileged -ti --name step1 oracle-12c:step1 /bin/bash`

6) ` # /tmp/install/install` (takes about 5m)
```
